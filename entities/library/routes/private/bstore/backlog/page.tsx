          <h2>How to use this</h2>
          <p>
            This is the working backlog behind the Foundation roadmap. Edge8 has proposed a
            priority for every item; the pills are yours to change. Your edits save in this
            browser. When you are happy, hit <strong>Copy summary</strong> and email it back, and
            we lock the roadmap together.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Now</strong> - part of the Foundation build starting immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Next</strong> - queued behind Now; mostly waiting on a sync or an API
              answer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Later</strong> - real, but after the foundation proves itself (Step 2
              candidates).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Park</strong> - visible but not planned.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="lead">
            <strong>The two-step logic:</strong> Step 1 syncs data one way, read-only and masked,
            out of your systems into your own central database. That alone unlocks every report
            here. Step 2 picks a short list of workflows to automate properly, which needs two-way
            sync and per-system API research. We choose Step 2 items together once Step 1 is live.
          </p>
          <p className="site-body-sm u-mb-0">
            <strong>Token estimates</strong> are pre-research ranges (1 token = 1 hour of Edge8
            expert time). The Foundation fee covers the database, the first syncs and 2 to 4
            builds chosen from this backlog; beyond that, work draws on prepaid token packs with a
            written estimate approved before each build.

          <p className="group-intro u-m-0 u-mt-2">
            Data sync is required for everything on this page. The centralized database is the
            core: sources feed it one way, everything you get out of it reads from it. The schema
            starts from Edge8&apos;s Company OS template (about 80 tables covering CRM, HR,
            commerce, content and reporting), trimmed and fitted to a retailer.
