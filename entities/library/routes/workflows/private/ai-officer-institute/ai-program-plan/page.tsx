              The AI Officer Institute certifies people through structured learning. Every learner
              works toward one certification track at a time, earning credit by completing the
              challenge attached to each session. There are three tracks:

            <p className="app-lead">
              Video is the front door to the program. Learners watch, and their watch time turns
              into progress. Here is how the video layer is shaping up:
            </p>
            <ul className="app-list">
              <li>
                <strong>General library of full-length videos.</strong> The complete sessions,
                browsable in one place.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shorts, catalogued not browsed.</strong> Sections of the full-length videos
                are cut into shorts and catalogued against the slides and sections they map to. We
                display them in context, but there is no browsable shorts library, people won&rsquo;t
                browse shorts initially.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Videos link out.</strong> Each video connects to its Mission Overview, Core
                Missions, Micro Sessions, and Blogs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Watch time counts.</strong> We can log the time learners spend on videos and
                give them credit toward their progress.

              to the current certification <strong>once</strong>, the same micro-session cannot be
