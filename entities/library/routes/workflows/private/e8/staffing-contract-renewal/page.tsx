            <div className="wf-problem">
              <strong>One deal, one contract.</strong> Every contract year is its own deal. The signed agreement is a
              Google Doc linked in the deal&apos;s <code>metadata.contract_url</code>. Never stretch an old deal to
              cover a new year.
            </div>
            <div className="wf-problem">
              <strong>Every deal has exactly one type.</strong> <code>metadata.type</code> is <code>new</code>,{' '}
              <code>renewal</code>, or <code>expansion</code>. Same team, next year: renewal. Bigger team or wider
              scope: expansion. First contract with the client: new.
            </div>
            <div className="wf-problem">
              <strong>Renewals chain backwards.</strong> Every renewal or expansion deal carries{' '}
              <code>metadata.renews_deal_id</code> pointing at the deal it replaces, so the full history of a client
              reads as a chain from the original deal to the current one.
            </div>
            <div className="wf-problem">
              <strong>Categories carry the money.</strong> <code>metadata.categories</code> is a list of{' '}
              <code>{'{name, amount_usd}'}</code> entries (Staffing, AI Program, Keynote, AIOlabz). A deal can hold
              more than one category; the amounts must always sum to the deal value.
