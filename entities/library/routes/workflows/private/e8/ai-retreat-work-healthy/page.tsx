            The patient treatment workflow alone is about 60% of what the team does each day. A working demo is also the
            change-management lever: the team is attached to the legacy system and skeptical it can be replaced in
            months, and a 20-minute vision presentation landed in silence. Working software is the answer to that
            silence.
