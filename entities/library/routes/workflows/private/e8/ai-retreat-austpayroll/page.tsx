            Twenty years of classroom training revenue is declining, and an acquisition target in the same space shows
            the same trend. The waste is obvious: a busy payroll professional gives up a full day to sit through eight
            hours of content and may already know six and a half hours of it. The play is to blow up that model with
            assessment-driven micro-learning. The content pipeline already works, built solo and self-taught. The weak
            point, in Tracy&apos;s words: &quot;it just looks ugly.&quot;
